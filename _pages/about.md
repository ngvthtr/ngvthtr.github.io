Hello, I'm Thien Trang, a final year student majoring in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, [School of Information and Communication Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/home). I am currently doing research under the guidance of Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). At the same time, I am also a member of [Data Science Laboratory](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/), advised by M.S. [Ngo Van Linh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
